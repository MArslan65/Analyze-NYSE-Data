# Analyze-NYSE-Data In Excel
In this project, I analyze real-life data from the New York Stock Exchange dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies.
In this project, I go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing any inferences from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. I also create a presentation to communicate the results in informative ways.
I calculated three tasks in this project:
## Task 1:
Calculate summary statistics and create a presentation that shares the visual and summary information

## Task 2:
Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit and Operating Profit for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.
## Task 3:
We created a financial model for a company for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case, and Base case).  
Revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin change for each scenario
